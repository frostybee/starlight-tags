Explore live demos of all available components. Each demo uses real tag data from this documentation site's configuration.

## Available Demos

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [PageTags](/demos/page-tags) | Auto-displays tags from page frontmatter |
| [PageWithTags](/demos/page-with-tags) | Wrapper component with position control |
| [TagBadge](/demos/tag-badge) | Individual tag badge with variants |
| [TagsList](/demos/tags-list) | Collection of tags with layouts |
| [PrerequisiteChain](/demos/prerequisite-chain) | Visual dependency chains |
| [Extended Schema](/demos/extended-schema) | Custom fields with product documentation example |

## How These Demos Work

These demo pages have real tags defined in their frontmatter, allowing components like `PageTags` to work exactly as they would in your documentation.

For example, the [PageTags demo](/demos/page-tags) page has:

```yaml
---
title: PageTags Demo
tags:
  - rest-api
  - authentication
  - beginner
---
```

This lets you see the components in action with real data rather than mocked examples.
