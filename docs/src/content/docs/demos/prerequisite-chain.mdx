This page demonstrates the `PrerequisiteChain` component, which displays visual dependency chains between topics.

:::tip[Prerequisites Required]
This component only displays data for tags that have `prerequisites` defined in your `tags.yml` configuration.
:::

## Basic Usage

The `webhooks` tag has prerequisites defined (`authentication` and `rest-api`):

<PrerequisiteChainDemo tagId="webhooks" />

## API Version Chain

The `api-v2` tag shows a migration path from v1:

<PrerequisiteChainDemo tagId="api-v2" />

## Without Description

Hide the helper text for a more compact display:

<PrerequisiteChainDemo tagId="webhooks" showDescription={false} />

```astro
<PrerequisiteChain
  tag={webhooksTag}
  tagsMap={tagsMap}
  showDescription={false}
/>
```

## Limiting Chain Length

For tags with many prerequisites, you can limit the display:

<PrerequisiteChainDemo tagId="webhooks" maxChainLength={2} />

```astro
<PrerequisiteChain
  tag={currentTag}
  tagsMap={tagsMap}
  maxChainLength={2}
/>
```

## How Prerequisites Work

Prerequisites are defined in your `tags.yml` configuration:

```yaml
tags:
  rest-api:
    label: "REST API"
    description: "RESTful API endpoints"

  authentication:
    label: "Authentication"
    prerequisites:
      - rest-api  # Must understand REST API first

  webhooks:
    label: "Webhooks"
    prerequisites:
      - authentication  # Must understand auth first
      - rest-api        # And REST API basics
```

The component automatically:
1. Reads the `prerequisiteChain` computed property from the tag
2. Resolves the full chain recursively (prerequisites of prerequisites)
3. Displays tags in order with arrows between them
4. Highlights the current tag with "You are here"

## Use Cases

### API Migration Paths

Show users how to migrate between API versions:

<PrerequisiteChainDemo tagId="api-v2" />

### Learning Paths

Guide users through a sequence of topics they should understand:

<PrerequisiteChainDemo tagId="webhooks" />

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile devices (< 768px):
- The chain displays vertically instead of horizontally
- Arrows rotate 90 degrees to point downward
- Resize your browser to see this in action
