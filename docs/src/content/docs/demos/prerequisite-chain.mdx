import { PrerequisiteChain } from 'starlight-tags/components';

This page demonstrates the `PrerequisiteChain` component, which displays visual dependency chains between topics.

:::tip[Prerequisites Required]
This component only displays data for tags that have `prerequisites` defined in your `tags.yml` configuration.
:::

## Basic Usage

The `js-async` tag has prerequisites defined (`js-functions`):

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-async" />

```astro
import { PrerequisiteChain } from 'starlight-tags/components';

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-async" />
```

## Full Learning Path

The `js-objects` tag shows a longer chain through arrays, functions, variables, and basics:

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-objects" />

## Without Description

Hide the helper text for a more compact display:

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-async" showDescription={false} />

```astro
<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-async" showDescription={false} />
```

## Limiting Chain Length

For tags with many prerequisites, you can limit the display:

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-objects" maxChainLength={3} />

```astro
<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-objects" maxChainLength={3} />
```

## How Prerequisites Work

Prerequisites are defined in your `tags.yml` configuration:

```yaml
tags:
  js-basics:
    label: "JS Basics"
    description: "Introduction to JavaScript fundamentals"

  js-variables:
    label: "Variables"
    prerequisites:
      - js-basics  # Must understand basics first

  js-functions:
    label: "Functions"
    prerequisites:
      - js-variables  # Must understand variables first
```

The component automatically:
1. Reads the `prerequisiteChain` computed property from the tag
2. Resolves the full chain recursively (prerequisites of prerequisites)
3. Displays tags in order with arrows between them
4. Highlights the current tag with "You are here"

## Use Cases

### Audience Progression

Show users how content builds from beginner to advanced:

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="advanced" />

### Learning Paths

Guide users through a sequence of topics they should understand:

<PrerequisiteChain tagId="js-arrays" />

## Responsive Behavior

On mobile devices (< 768px):
- The chain displays vertically instead of horizontally
- Arrows rotate 90 degrees to point downward
- Resize your browser to see this in action
