Get up and running with the Acme API in just a few minutes.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.acme.com/v2
```

## Your First Request

Make a simple request to verify your API key works:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.acme.com/v2/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Authentication

All requests require an API key passed in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can generate API keys in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.acme.com/api-keys).
