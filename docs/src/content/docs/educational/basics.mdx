JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the interactive web. Let's start with the fundamentals.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that runs in web browsers and on servers (via Node.js).

```javascript
// Your first JavaScript code
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Where JavaScript Runs

1. In browsers for client-side scripting
2. On Node.js for server-side applications
3. With Electron for desktop applications
4. With React Native for mobile applications

## Adding JavaScript to HTML

### Inline Script

```html
<script>
  console.log("Hello from inline script!");
</script>
```

### External File

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

## Comments

```javascript
// Single-line comment

/*
  Multi-line
  comment
*/
```

## Console Methods

```javascript
console.log("Regular message");
console.warn("Warning message");
console.error("Error message");
console.table({ name: "John", age: 30 });
```
