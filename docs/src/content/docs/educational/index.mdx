Welcome to the JavaScript learning path! This series of tutorials demonstrates how the **educational tag schema** works with difficulty levels and prerequisites.

## Learning Path Overview

Each topic builds on the previous one, with clear difficulty levels and prerequisites:

| Topic | Difficulty | Prerequisites |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| [Basics](/starlight-tags/educational/basics/) | Beginner | None |
| [Variables](/starlight-tags/educational/variables/) | Beginner | Basics |
| [Functions](/starlight-tags/educational/functions/) | Beginner | Variables |
| [Arrays](/starlight-tags/educational/arrays/) | Intermediate | Functions |
| [Objects](/starlight-tags/educational/objects/) | Intermediate | Arrays |
| [Async JS](/starlight-tags/educational/async/) | Advanced | Functions |

## Filter by Difficulty

Use the filter below to find content matching your skill level:

<FilterableByDifficulty />

## Prerequisite Chain Example

The `PrerequisiteChain` component shows what you need to learn before tackling advanced topics:

<PrerequisiteChain tag="js-async" />

## How This Works

This learning path uses the **extended tag schema** with educational fields:

```yaml
# In tags.yml
js-functions:
  label: "Functions"
  difficulty: beginner        # Educational field
  contentType: tutorial       # Educational field
  prerequisites: ["js-variables"]  # Educational field
```

See the [Extended Schema Demo](/starlight-tags/demos/extended-schema/) for implementation details.
